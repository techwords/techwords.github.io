Because you are using the same tool as your developers, requesting document reviews is simplified because you are using the same tool.</p> <p>GitHub Pages is a static web service that can be used for blogs and product documentation. GitHub Pages takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files from a repository on GitHub and publishes a website. It is a great way to host your personal website, portfolio, blog, or documentation for your open source projects.</p> <p>Benefits of using GitHub Pages:</p> <ul> <li>Easy to use: GitHub pages is easy to use, even if you're not a developer. To create a GitHub Pages site, all you need to do is create a repository on GitHub and push your static files to the repository. GitHub will automatically publish your website.</li> <li>Free to use: GitHub Pages is free to use for public repositories. If you have a private repository, you can use GitHub Pages if you have a paid GitHub plan.</li> <li>Custom domains: You can use your own custom domain name for your GitHub Pages site.
