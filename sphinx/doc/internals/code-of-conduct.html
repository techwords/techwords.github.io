<span id="code-of-conduct"></span><h1>Sphinx Code of Conduct<a class="headerlink" href="#sphinx-code-of-conduct" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>Like the technical community as a whole, the Sphinx team and community is made
up of volunteers from all over the world.
Diversity is a strength, but it can also lead to communication issues and
unhappiness. To that end, we have a few ground rules that we ask people to
adhere to.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Be friendly and patient.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Be welcoming.</strong>
We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all
backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of
any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour, immigration status,
social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender
identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion,
and mental and physical ability.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Be considerate.</strong>
Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the
work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues, and
you should take those consequences into account when making decisions.
Remember that we’re a world-wide community, so you might not be communicating
in someone else’s primary language.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Be respectful.</strong>
Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor
behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and
then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack.
It’s important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or
threatened is not a productive one. Members of the Sphinx community should be
respectful when dealing with other members as well as with people outside the
Sphinx community.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Be careful in the words that you choose.</strong>
We are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally.
Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment
and other exclusionary behavior aren’t acceptable. This includes, but is not
limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Violent threats or language directed against another person.</p></li>
<li><p>Discriminatory jokes and language.</p></li>
<li><p>Posting sexually explicit or violent material.</p></li>
<li><p>Posting (or threatening to post) other people’s personally identifying
information (“doxing”).</p></li>
<li><p>Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.</p></li>
<li><p>Unwelcome sexual attention.</p></li>
<li><p>Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.</p></li>
<li><p>Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then
stop.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>When we disagree, try to understand why.</strong>
Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time and Sphinx is no
exception. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views
constructively. Remember that we’re different. Different people have different
perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a
viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that it is human to
err and blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping
to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This isn’t an exhaustive list of things that you can’t do.
Rather, take it in the spirit in which it’s intended - a guide to make it easier
to enrich all of us and the technical communities in which we participate.
This code of conduct applies to all spaces of the Sphinx community.</p>
